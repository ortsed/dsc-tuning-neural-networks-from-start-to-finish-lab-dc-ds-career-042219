    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've seen some regularization, initialization and optimization techniques, its time to synthesize those concepts into a cohesive modeling pipeline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With this pipeline, you will not only fit an initial model but will also attempt to set various hyperparameters for regularization techniques. Your final model selection will pertain to the test metrics across these models. This will more naturally simulate a problem you might be faced with in practice, and the various modeling decisions you are apt to encounter along the way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our end objective is to achieve a balance between overfitting and underfitting. You've seen the bias variance trade-off, and the role of regularization in order to reduce overfitting on training data and improving generalization to new cases. Common frameworks for such a procedure include train/validate/test methodology when data is plentiful, and K-folds cross-validation for smaller, more limited datasets. In this lab, you'll perform the latter, as the dataset in question is fairly limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement a K-folds cross validation modeling pipeline\n",
    "* Apply normalization as a preprocessing technique\n",
    "* Apply regularization techniques to improve your model's generalization\n",
    "* Choose an appropriate optimization strategy "

Fit the model using all of the training and validation data using the architecture and hyperparameters that were most effective in your experiments above. Afterwards, measure the overall performance on the hold-out test data which has been left untouched (and hasn't leaked any data into the modeling process)!"

    "In this lab, you investigated some data from *The Lending Club* in a complete data science pipeline regarding neural networks. You began with reserving a hold-out set for testing which never was touched during the modeling phase. From there, you implemented a k-fold cross validation methodology in order to assess an initial baseline model and various regularization methods. From here, you'll begin to investigate other neural network architectures such as CNNs."
